# Overview

## Model

## Metrics

# NPS & Telemetry

# Key Variables and Parameters

Identify and describe critical uncertainties within the model with regards to parameters and decision variables. Identify those uncertainties that may be dynamic (stochastic). 

  - Three variables of interest
    - pNPS 
    - PSI and Star rating
    - Telemetry
  - Discretize probabilities. 
  - We are given time series data for two years.

Segment    | Total Products | Products w/both Sentiment and NPS | w/Battery | w/Wifi | w/Driver Reliabity
---------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---- | -----------
Consumer   | 487            |      74              | TBD     | TBD  |     TBD
Commercial | 238            |      46              | TBD     | TBD  |     TBD

Figure \ref{fig:overall_summary} provides a broad overview of the trends within pNPS, PIS and the star rating.  Note that pNPS was calculated using the given formula.  PIS was calculated by:
\begin{equation}
PIS = \frac{\text{Positive mentions}- \text{Negative mentions}}{\text{Positive mentions}+ \text{Negative mentions}}\times 100.
\end{equation}
The period of interest is one month.  Star ratings are averaged over a month for each segment. In order to observe trends, star rating is scaled by a multiplicative factor of 20.  Further note that as ownership durating is avaiable only for the surveys, the PIS and Star rating per segment will be identical in each facet.
