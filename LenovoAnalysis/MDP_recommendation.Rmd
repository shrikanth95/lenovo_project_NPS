# Problem Formulation: Evolution Tracking

## States

Our state matrix would be a combination of the telemetry and sentiment transition matrices.  Our final state would be $\{(++,N), (+,N),(0,N),(-,N),(--,N),(++,AN), (+,AN),(0,AN),(-,AN),(--,AN)\}$.  The states and ranges are described below:

### Sentiment states 

We consider PSI values (Five states $S_S \in \{++,+, 0, -, --\}$) and is referred to as $P_{S}$.

  - ++: PSI above the 80\% quantile (Above 65)
  - +: PSI between 80 and 60\% quantile (between 60 and 65)
  - 0: PSI between 40 and 60\% quantile (between 45 and 60)
  - -: PSI between 20 and 40\% quantile (between 42 and 45)
  - --: PSI below 20\% quantile (below 42)

```{r}
n.sent = 5 
tmp <- sentiment.consumer.all %>%
  group_by(#ProductName,
           time = floor_date(as.Date(Comment.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y"), unit = "week")) %>%
  calcPSI()
# Define PSI categories
VERY_HIGH <- 65.0
MOD_HIGH <- 60.0
NORMAL <- 45.0
MOD_LOW <- 42.0

res <- sentiment.consumer.all %>%
  group_by(#ProductName,
           time = floor_date(as.Date(Comment.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y"), unit = "week")) %>%
  PSITransitions(VERY_HIGH, MOD_HIGH, NORMAL, MOD_LOW)

knitr::kable(res$P, row.names=TRUE, caption = "P - Consumer, Weekly")
tmp = as.matrix(res$P,ncol = 5,nrow = 5)
p.s = matrix(as.numeric(tmp[1:5,2:6]),ncol = 5, nrow= 5)
rownames(p.s) = colnames(tmp)[2:6]
colnames(p.s) = colnames(tmp)[2:6]

```


### Telemetry

Assuming we have a time-series of telemetry data, states can be defined between normal operation $N$ and abnormal operation $AN$.  The no-action transition matrix can be constructed from defining thresholds in the hours of battery life and in the crash rate related to specific driver updates (Two states $S_T\in \{N, AN\}$) and is referred to as $P_{T}$.

An example of how the telemetry is used is as follows.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
telemetry.con <- read.csv("../RawData/Driver_Health_consumer_ideapad.csv", header = TRUE)

telemetry.comm <- read.csv("../RawData/Driver_Health_consumer_ideapad.csv", header = TRUE)

telemetry.con <- telemetry.con %>% mutate(Driver.Name = as.character(Driver.Name),
                                          Crashes = as.numeric(Crashes), 
                                          Percent.Impacted = as.numeric(sub("%", "",Percent.Impacted)),
                                          Total.Machines = as.numeric(Total.Machines)) %>%
  mutate(Percent.crash = Crashes/Total.Machines*100)

q.1 <- quantile(telemetry.con$Percent.crash[telemetry.con$Driver.Name == 'atikmpag.sys'], probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
# quantile(telemetry.con$Percent.Impacted[telemetry.con$Driver.Name == 'atikmpag.sys'], probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
knitr::kable(q.1, caption = "For the crash-rate percentage, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 Quantiles of the atikmpag.sys driver are as follows.")
```

Assuming driver updates are released because of a high crash-rate, we calculate the percent crash-rate from 

$$c_{t} =  \frac{\text{Number Crashes for a specifc driver}}{\text{Number Machines associted with the driver}}$$.

We then define a threshold 50\% quantile level $\gamma$ above which the epoch is labelled as Abnormal operation.

```{r}
n.tel = 2
p.tel = matrix(c(0.75, 0.25, 0.25, 0.75),nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(p.tel) <- c("N","AN")
colnames(p.tel) <- c("N","AN")
knitr::kable(p.tel ,  caption = "A possible telemetry transtion matrix from ",  row.names = TRUE)

```


The final state matrix $P$ would be a combination of $P_S$ and $P_T$ given by


$$P_{1}(s,t->s_1,t_1) = P_S(s)P_S(s_1)P_T(t)P_T(t_1)$$


## Actions

The actions are chosen between performing an intervention and doing nothing.  

- A shift towards normal operating mode is expected in the telemetry state transition matrix associated with the intervention.  The transition matrix is denoted as $P_{T,1}$.  As the telemetry is not provided, we assume that the transition probabilities corresponding to positive and negative sentiment will increase and decrease respectively by a predefined factor $\gamma_T$.

- A relatively small shift is expected in the sentiment transition matrix as the population is relatively late to react to improvements.  This is referred to as $P_{S,1}$.The new sentiment transition matrix can be estimated similarly by choosing the fraction by which probabilities will change.  This is denoted by $\gamma_S$. Note that $\gamma_S<\gamma_T$.  


The joint transition matrix $P_1$ is associated with the combination of $P_{S,1}$ and $P_{T,1}$.

```{r}
p.t = p.tel
p.s = p.s

p.s
matrix(rep(p.s[,1],n.tel*n.sent), ncol = n.tel*n.sent, nrow = n.tel*n.sent, byrow = FALSE)

# Calcualtion of join probability matrix
combine.telemetry.sentiment(number.sentiment.states = n.sent,number.telemetry.states = n.tel,sentiment.probability.matix = p.s, telemetry.probability.matix = p.t)
```


## Rewards
A cost $r_k$ is incurred when an intervention $k\in\{1,2\}$ is performed.  The no-action cost matrix that incentivize transitions towards higher sentiment scores are denoted by $R_{T,S,1}$.

```{r}
R.st1 = matrix(c(100, 75, 50, -25, -50, -100, 
             100, 70, 45, -30, -55, -100,
             100, 65, 40, -35, -60, -100,
             100, 70, 45, -40, -65, -100,
             100, 65, 40, -35, -70, -100,
             100, 60, 35, -45, -80, -100),nrow = 6, ncol = 6,byrow = TRUE)
rownames(R.st1) <- c("+,N","0,N","-,N","+,AN","0,AN","-,AN")
colnames(R.st1) <- c("+,N","0,N","-,N","+,AN","0,AN","-,AN")
knitr::kable(R.st1 ,  caption = "A suggested no-action reward function",  row.names = TRUE)
```

The reward matrix $R_{S,T,2}$ associated with an intervention should be calculated based on $P_{1}$ as $$R_{S,T,2}(s,t->s_1,t_1) = -r_2+\sum_{x}\left(R_{S,T,1}(s,t->x)\right) P_1(s,t->x)$$ where $x\in\{(+,N),(0,N),(-,N),(+,AN),(0,AN),(-,AN)\}$

From the consumer telemetry data (Ideapad) of driver health, the 50 percentile of the percentage of devices impacted is found to be 0.32\%.  For the initial run, we define two discrete states above and below the 50 percentile mark denoted by $M$ and $S$ indicating minor impact and severe impact respectively.  


```{r}
# Initial parameters
beta = 1.1
N = 4 # Number of states
K = 2 # Number of actions
```


As the data is skewed above zero, 50 is chosen as a threshold.  We define the following probability matrices

```{r}
# p.original <- c(0.88, 0.12, 0.067, 0.933) for PSI above and below 50 # Transition matrix from original consumer data.  Check/Ask for picture in Slack for all details.

p.true <- matrix(c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 
                   0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 
                   0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 
                   0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
p.int <- matrix(c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0,
                  0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0,
                  0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1,
                  0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
P = array(c(p.true, p.int), dim=c(4,4,2))
r.true <- matrix(c(100, 50, -25, -100,
                   100, 40, -30, -100,
                   100, 60, -40, -100,
                   100, 60, -40, -100), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)*beta
r.int <- matrix(c(100, 50, -25, -100,
                  100, 40, -30, -100,
                  100, 60, -40, -100,
                  100, 60, -40, -100), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
R = array(c(r.true, r.int), dim=c(4,4,2))
```

## Expected rewards

The immediate expected reward $q_{ik}$for performing an intervention $(k=1)$ and doing nothing $(k=2)$ for states $i$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
q_{ik} = \sum_{j=1}^{3} P\{i,j\}(k) r_{i,j}
\end{equation}

```{r}
q = matrix(0, nrow = K, ncol = N)
for(k in 1:K){
  q[k,] = rowSums(t(P[,,k]*R[,,k]))
}
```


```{r}
mdp_check(P, R)
# Discount factor
discount <- 0.95
# Objective is to maximize rewards
# Linear Programming
mdp_LP(P, R, discount)

```
